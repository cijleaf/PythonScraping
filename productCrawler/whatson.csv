As I paint, I go with my gut to see if there is an innate and natural painting style.  A process of painting without a specific plan and attempting to remove self judgement from the art - at least at the beginning of creation.  Many of my painting series look very different from each other.  At this point in time, I’ve opened up the possibilities to style, rather than pre-empting them with just going with what was popular.  Yes,  I admit that this is a self indulgent exploration of creativity.

The theme for this ceremony is ‘Grief and Forgiveness’ that will acknowledge all our Ancestors and Ancestry across and down the generations.

Dr Jane Goodall uncovered the complexity of social and familial life within groups of wild chimpanzees, highlighting the connection between humans and our closest living relatives.Through her groundbreaking work in Tanzania’s Gombe Stream National Park, Dr Goodall redefined how scientists interact with the wild, contributing to one of the greatest studies of primates the world has ever seen.

The personal and the cultural come into conflict as Eddie tries to balance his responsibility to the men with his fierce connection to his wife Beatrice and her niece Catherine. As a tentative romance blossoms between Catherine and Rodolpho, Eddie’s complex web of love, loyalty and dark attraction begins to unravel around him.A landmark work from one of the greatest playwrights in history, the play burns with Miller’s searing social critique and richly-drawn characters.
